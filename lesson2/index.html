        <p><b>A Flower</b>, also known as a bloom or blossom,[1] is the reproductive structure found <i>flowering</i> plants 
            (plants of the division Angiospermae). <b><i>Flower</i></b> consist of a combination of vegetative organs – sepals that enclose and protect 
            the developing <i>flower</i>. Petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes, which in <i>flowering</i> plants 
            produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female 
            gametophytes are contained within the ovules produced in the ovary.[2][3] In some plants, multiple <i>flowers</i> occur singly on a pedicel
            (flower stalk), and some are arranged in a group (inflorescence) on a peduncle (inflorescence stalk).[2]</p>
        <p><b><i>Flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different
            flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored, large petals with
             patterns only visible to under ultraviolet light, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for 
             pollinators.</i></b>[4][2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators to be mutually dependent on 
              services they provide to one another—in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of
               food.[5]</p>
               <p>
                <b><i>When pollen from the anther of a flower is transferred to the stigma to another, it is called pollination.</i></b> Some flowers
                 may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different <i>flower</i> of the same plant, but others have mechanisms 
                 to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to
                  the stigma of another <i>flower</i> on a different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where 
                  the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma.
                   <b>This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.
                    [6] </b>Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).[7] After fertilization, the ovary of the
                    flower develops into fruit containing seeds.[2]

         <h2>Etymology</h2>
         <p>
            <b>flowers</b> is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in plants, 
            before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. 
            The early word for flower in English was <i>blossom</i>,[8] though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.[9]

         <h3>Morphology</h3>
         <p>
            <b>The morphology</b> of a flower, or its form and structure,[10] can be considered in two parts: the vegetative part, consisting 
            of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive or sexual parts. <i>A stereotypical flower</i> is made up of 
            four kinds of structures arranged in whorls around the tip of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle.[11][2] The four 
            main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx, corolla, androecium, 
            and gynoecium. Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the perianth, and in 
            <b><i>monocotyledons</i></b>, may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described as tepals.[2][12]
